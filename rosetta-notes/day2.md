### Construction of the preterite


·The preterite of regular verbs is constructed by adding-ed or-d to the verb in the infinitive. The verbs that end with-y have a preterite ending of-ied.

Example: Yesterday I watched a movie.

The baby cried a lot last night.

·The construction of irregular verbs in the preterite does not have a precise rule. They must therefore be learned by heart.

Example: When did (to do)you first meet him?

I first met (to meet) him yesterday. I went (to go) to Spain

### 'Also' - 'As well' - 'Too' 

The synonyms 'also,' 'as well' and 'too' are placed differently within sentences.
·'Also' is placed before a simple verb, before the main verb in a compound tense, after 'to be' used as a stative verb, or at the end of a clause. Example:
I also have a trailer.
My lawyer had also raised that point.
There is also a basement downstairs. I have one also.
The synonyms 'also,' 'as well' and 'too' are placed differently within sentences.
·'As well' ends a sentence. Example:
These two want some chocolate mousse as well!
The synonyms 'also,' 'as wvell' and 'too' are placed differently within sentences.
·'Too' usually ends a clause. It is at times placed after'its referent for emphasis; in these rare cases, commas set off 'too.' Example:
Splash him too.
John, too, was impressed with the demonstration.



### Different meanings of 'all'



·'All' precedes and modifies uncountable or plural countable nouns. When it designates all of something limited, the noun follows 'the' or a demonstrative or possessive adjective.
Example:
The cat drank all the milk.
Make sure you take all your pills! Note. When 'all' modifies something unlimited, no article precedes the noun.
Example:
All children like sweets.
The Internet has spread to all sectors of the population.
·'All' may also be used in two ways with personal pronouns: personal pronoun + 'all', or 'all of + personal pronoun.
Example:
Have you read these books? I've read them all.
or I've read all of them.
·When 'all' is used with a subject pronoun, it may occupy various positions in the sentence. It is placed either before a simple verb, or after a modal, an auxiliary, or 'to be'.
Example: The girls all left early.
We will all have some tomato juice. They're all ready to go.
Note. In a short answer, 'all' precedes the auxiliary, modal, or 'to be'.
Example:
Did you guys go to the movies with your friends? Yes,we all did.
·'All' may be used as an object pronoun. Example: That's all we have.
That's all we need.
Note. In such cases, 'all' is in fact short for 'all that'.



### The verb 'to have'



A-Construction

To have is both an auxiliary and an ordinary verb, and is conjugated in the present indicative as follows: Ihave

we have you have

you have he/she/it has

they have B-Use

·The verb to have expressing possession is often followed by got (past participle of to get) in everyday speech.

The auxiliary have disappears completely sometimes, which results in: I got, he got... Example: You've got (or you got) a nice

sweater.

·In the interrogative and negative forms,to have (got) is conjugated with the auxilary do, as with an ordinary verb. In these two forms, got is never used.

Example:

Do you have a car?

How many children do you have? Did you have a good time? Yes, we did. She doesn't have any pets.

I didn't have my credit card with me. 



Note.

The questions introduced by the interrogative pronoun 'who' are formed without 'do', but short answers and emphatic structures are formed with 'do'.

Example:

'Who has some paper?' 'I do.' They do have nice daughters.
