### compound noun

·The compound noun is made up of a principal noun preceded by one or several nouns or a noun phrase that has the same function1 as an adjective.

Example:an alarm clock, a bedroom,

the London-New York flight

·The first element is always in the singular, even if it has a plural sense, except if it exists only in the plural form or if there is risk of ambiguity.

Example: ski boots, a clothes factory, a goods-train (risk of ambiguity if'good' was in the singular )

·Most compound nouns are written as two (or several) separate words. Some of them are written with a dash, others as a single word. Example: a great-grandfather, housework

Note. The same compound noun can sometimes be written as two words, with a dash or as single word.

Example: ice-cream, ice cream.

·The following verbs are normally active when they introduce infinitive clauses: 'to want,' 'to like,' 'to love,' 'to wish,' 'to get,' and 'to cause.'

Example:

He wants John to rent a replacement vehicle. When would you like your car to be ready?

·The following verbs may be active or passive when they introduce infinitive clauses:

'to intend,' 'to mean,' 'to force,' 'to compel,' 'to order,' 'to forbid,' and 'to expect.'

Note 'Not' precedes the infinitive. Example:

or more to get to the airport. We've planned a 10% increase for next year.

·'The next' is used with the same

expressions of time as is 'next'. However, the former expression indicates a future time relative not to the moment of speech or writing, but to some other (past or future) moment which is mentioned or understood. Example: I'll spend the first week in Paris

and the next two weeks in Rome. She said she was leaving the next day.

You'll get your checkbook in the
